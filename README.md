# LaZBot Plugins

These are various small plugins for my [LaZBot](https://github.com/jdost/lazbot)
slackbot framework.

## Ballotbox

A polling plugin, this allows for people to make polls (currently only boolean) in
a channel that are voted on using reaction emoji.  The polls are linked to a user
per channel, so you (a specific user) can only have one active poll in each channel.

## Reactor

This is a playful plugin that has the bot automatically react to different user's
messages on specific days.

## Condor

Another playful plugin, this one figures out if this is an allowable day and then
applies various fun filters.
